Applied quality analytics project using SPC, control charts, and process capability analysis to optimize manufacturing stability and minimize total cost of quality using simulation-based decision making.

# Quality Analytics: Process Stability, Capability & Cost Optimization

## Project Overview
This project simulates the role of a **Quality Manager** at a newly established manufacturing plant, **Gainsborough Manufacturing Company**. The objective is to ensure the manufacturing process is both **statistically stable and capable**, while **minimizing the total cost of quality** through data-driven decision making.

The project leverages **Statistical Process Control (SPC)** techniques, **process capability analysis**, and **quality cost trade-off evaluation** using a simulation-based environment.

## Business Objective
- Maintain process stability using real-time control charts
- Assess whether processes are capable of meeting specifications
- Minimize total cost of quality by balancing:
  - Prevention costs
  - Appraisal costs
  - Internal failure costs
  - External failure costs

---

## Key Concepts & Skills Demonstrated
- Statistical Process Control (SPC)
- X̄ (X-bar) and R control charts
- Control limit calculation
- Process capability analysis (Cp, Cpk)
- Cost of Quality optimization
- Data-driven operational decision-making
- Simulation-based analytics
- Minitab for quality analytics

## Tools & Technologies
- **Minitab**
- **Quality Analytics Simulation (Harvard Business Publishing)**
- Statistical Quality Control methods
- Descriptive & inferential analytics

## Project Structure
The project is organized into four major challenges:

---

## Challenge 1: Control Limit Calculation
- Calculated **Upper Control Limits (UCL)** and **Lower Control Limits (LCL)** for:
  - X̄ (mean) chart
  - R (range) chart
- Used subgroup size of 5
- Control limits were calculated using:
  - Minitab
  - Statistical formulas for SPC
- Results met accuracy requirements within ±5% tolerance

📌 *Outcome:* Established reliable control limits for monitoring process behavior.

---

## Challenge 2: Process Control & Cost Minimization
- Applied calculated control limits in real time
- Identified out-of-control signals
- Took corrective actions including:
  - Equipment recalibration
  - Labor substitutions
- Balanced cost of intervention vs defect costs

📊 **Result:**  
- Total Cost of Quality achieved: **~$2,964**  
- Benchmark requirement: **≤ $4,000**

✅ Process maintained in control while minimizing internal and external defects.

---

## Challenge 3: Process Capability Analysis
- Evaluated multiple processes using defect frequency data
- Calculated **process capability indexes**
- Determined whether each process could consistently meet specifications

📌 *Outcome:* Successfully differentiated between processes that were:
- In statistical control
- Capable vs not capable of meeting specifications

---

## Challenge 4: Quality Investment Optimization
- Experimented with investments in:
  - Prevention (training, equipment, suppliers)
  - Appraisal (sampling size and frequency)
- Analyzed long-term effects on:
  - Defects
  - Failure costs
  - Total cost of quality

📊 **Result:**  
- Total Cost of Quality achieved: **~$8.3k**  
- Benchmark requirement: **≤ $8,000**

Demonstrated realistic trade-offs between upfront quality investments and long-term cost reduction.

---

## Key Results Summary
- Achieved process stability using SPC techniques
- Reduced total cost of quality below benchmark in Challenge 2
- Correctly assessed process capability across multiple scenarios
- Demonstrated strategic decision-making in quality investment planning
